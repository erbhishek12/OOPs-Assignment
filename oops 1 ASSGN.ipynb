    "ANSWER 1- Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.For example, we can consider a car as a class that has characteristics like steering wheels, seats, brakes, etc. And its behavior is mobility. Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.An object is a real-life entity that is defined as an instance of a class. The objects of a class called Animals, for example, will be a cat, dog, elephant, and so on. Each object has its own identity, attribute, and behavior.\n",

    "ANSWER 2- The four pillars of OOPs are-\n",
    "          a. Abstraction\n",
    "          b. Encapsulation\n",
    "          c. Inheritance\n",
    "          d. Polymorphism\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "ANSWER 3- The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes. \n",
    "For e.g.\n",
    "class pwskills1:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, student_id, email_id, mobile_number):\n",
    "        self.student_id1= student_id\n",
    "        self.email_id1= email_id\n",
    "        self.mobile_number1= mobile_number\n",
    "    def return_student_details(self):\n",
    "        return self.student_id1, self.email_id1, self.mobile_number1\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 4- Self is used to bind variable or object to a class. It represents the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER 5- Inheritance is defined as the mechanism of inheriting the properties of the base class to the child class.\n",
